This project's an idea for the facility the creation of MMORPG games in Typescript with Deno and NextJs. At first, I'm want to develop my skills with Deno, improve my skills with Typescript, and creation of games.

I will want in a second step create a type of Framework for games 2D like TFS, PyOT, or RPG-JS, or simply I fun with the difficulty this project represents for me.
